    "In the ScaleWays project, we aim to identify the most suitable places for extending rice production in the extended Lake Victoria Basin. But before, we need to identify which food and cash crops can be more suitable and/or profitable in the region. We assume that farmers are rational decision makers that will allocate their land to the most suitable+profitable crop. To identify these food and cash crop, hereafter 'potential competitors', we reviewed the FAO 'Food Balances' and 'Food price indices'. \n",

    "Different criteria can be used for rank these 'potential competitors'. If our interest is to ensure to include in the set of 'potential competitors', we should use the indicator of 'Food' that represents the \"food avaiable for human consumption\". Yet, 'Food' may overlook crops of commercial importance, such as Tea and Coffee. In that case, 'GrossProductionValue' will be a better indicator, but we don't have data for Uganda. If our interest is to select the crops based on the extent their are currently produced, 'Production' and 'Area harvested'\n",

    "Diets in East Africa are as heterogeneous as its agroecological zones. Sorghum and millet are widely cultivated and consumed in the semi-arid and arid regions, while platains and potatoes are cultivated in the humid highlands (see main food crops grown in Uganda in Figure 1). Maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, dark-green leaves, and rice are also important food crops in the region. Traditionally, cereal and grains were consumed in porridge ('uji' or 'ugali')  or in stews, and legumes, vegetables, and dark-green leaves were served as suplementary items. Cassava was seen as a reserve food, while meat was consumed during ceremonies or celebrations (Vorster, 1971). \n",

    "However, dietary patterns have rapidly changed in the last 50 years. Traditional and coarse grains have been replaced by rice and wheat (Kennedy \\& Reardon, 1994), consumption of processed foods and sugar have increased (Haggblade et al., 2016), and the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed has been insufficient to cover the micronutrient needs of the population (GNR, 2020). The following 4 figures show a decrease in the consumption of 'traditional' staples -sorghum, cassava, maize, and platains- and an increase in the consumption of rice in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. \n"

    "Rice in Uganda is sold through three main channels: public markets, small grocery stores, and supermarkets. These channels are targeted to very differetn type of consumers. Rice is sold in packages, mainly in small stores and supermarkets, and loose in public markets. Despite the different varieties of rice that are produced in the country, in the market, rice is branded based on its origin, domestic and foreign productiction, not its variety. "

    "Rapid urbanization and rural-to-urban migration, mordernization of food retailing, and increases in income have been correlated with these dietary changes (Haggblade et al., 2016). A comparison of the 2005 and 2015 expenditure share in the food basket in Kenya showed a larger increase in consumption of rice in urban areas than in rural areas in Kenya (KIHBS, 2015). A similar trend is observed when comparing income groups; rice is consumed more by high-income clases since traditional crops, such as sorghum, are considered “inferior” foods (Minot, 2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "These dietary changes have negative impacts on public health. In African countries that have experienced the nutritional transition earlier than in East Africa, e.g., South Africa, it has been observed an increase in overweight and obesity, micronutrient deficiencies, and non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cadiovascular diseases (Steyn \\& Mchiza, 2014). This can be partially explained by the substitution of whole-grains for refined grains and/or of traditional/diverse grains for standard-looking grains. But there are other processes influencing this, such as an increase in consumption of fast food and a decrease in consumption of vegetables and fruits. During the milling process, grains loss some vitamins that are contained in the bran and germ, such as vitamins B. For instance, brown rice and African rice (*Oryza glaberrima*) contain considerably more Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, and Folate than white rice (see Table 1). The same can be observed when comparing whole-wheat with wheat flour. Similarly, yellow maize, which is associated with 'animal feed' and considered as 'poor-people's food' (IPBO, 2017), is richer in Vitamin A than white maize.   \n",

    "Rice has grown in importance in East African countries, not only as food, but also as an economic opportunity. ... Something about rice consumption.... Rice serves both as a food staple for 70% of farming households and as a cash crop for 80% of these households ()... The share of total calories supplied by rice has been growing steadly since 1961 (Figure #). In the 60's, rice barely contributed to the kcal consumed in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda; yet, in 2013, it contributed with 2-5% of the calories consumed per capita in these countries. In Tanzania, where rice can be considered a staple, the share of calories coming from rice has increased from 3.7% in 1961 to 9.2% in 2013. \n",

    "Due to its popularity and demand, especially concerning aromatic rice, EAC countries import rice. Although Tanzania is largely self-sufficient and imports merely 140,000 MT rice per annum, other EAC import rice to varying degrees: Kenya imports 0.3 million MT and Rwanda imports 20 MT  (KilimoTrust, 2014a, p. 8). Rice is mainly imported from Asian countries (see Fig. 3), which is prized lower than rice produced in the region. The main rice exporters are Pakistan, Thailand, Tanzania, India and China, who combined exported a total of 1.1 million tons of rice in 2018 -an increase of 30% compared to year 2015 (UN Comtrade, 2020). Yet, trade within the EAC region plays a significant role in covering national demands; for example, Tanzania exported 82,300 t to Uganda in 2018 and 5,100 t to Burundi. Uganda also exported half of its production to other countries, such as Congo and South Sudan (UN Comtrade, 2020).   \n",

    "Rice self-sufficiency has been rarely achieved in the last years in East African countries, with the exception of Tanzania. Although we have observed an increase in the harvested area and yields of paddy rice, domestic production has not been sufficient to cover the food demand for rice in Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya as shown in Figure 4. In Rwanda, for instance, the production-consumption ratio (P/C) shows that self-sufficiency was achieved only once in the period between 1961-2013.     \n",
